# ScotlandYard
This is a small project to create code to play the role of Mr X in the Scotland Yard board game.

In the board game, one player takes on the role of Mr X. and the others players are detectives trying to catch him. 
The game board is a map of London with all locations numbered and conected by taxis, buses, and underground routes.
Each player is given tickets for the different modes of transport.
The detectives have limited tickets, and each time they move they give their tickets to Mr X.
Mr X moves in secret and keeps records of his moves on a secret pad where he write th number for the location he moved to.
He covers the move with a ticket so the detectives know what type of transport he moved with.
Every so often, Mr X reveals his location.

The code is designed to accept player movements and to announce the transport used by Mr X on his turn and to reveal his location when appropriate. 
This allows players to play the board game with the code playing the role of Mr X.
At the end of the game, the code should reveal a table of everyone's movements.

## We are not looking for collaborators at this stage, and pull requests will not be accepted currently.
This will likely change once the basic game is set up and running.
